### Project Intro/Objective

Suicide and violence are on the rise. In today’s world it has become increasingly important to try and identify red flags in social media. Our project will try to determine the emotional state of Twitter users based on their tweets to flag users which may be a threat to themselves or others using Natural Language Processing and sentiment analysis. The overarching goal of this project will be to classify these tweets by emotion types

**Problem Statement:** Identify dangerous tweets based on tweets with negative connotations and reduce the number of dangerous tweets by 10\% by marking red flags to the users in the system.

**Data Analysis, Visualization, and Modeling**  
* Logistic Regression
* Topic Model

The visualizations for the models include: 
* Bar charts  
* Word clouds  
* Performance table (classification summary report)
